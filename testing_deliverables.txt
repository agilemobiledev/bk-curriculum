SWBAT write unit tests using rspec/minitest of the application models.

SWBAT write tests for the code they wish they had, and then implement that code so that their tests pass.

SWBAT articulate cases where testing is not useful, excessive, or doesn't deliver the value to justify its costs.

SWBAT mock objects in their tests and stub methods and their return values on those objects.
