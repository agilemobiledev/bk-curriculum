##RUBY

### ENVIRONMENT

* rspec, guard, irb, ruby keyword, installation

SWBAT dynamically evaluate Ruby code in a REPL using irb.
SWBAT run ruby programs from the command line using the ruby executable.
SWBAT assign a value to a local variable.

Arrays and Hashes

SWBAT manipulate arrays including adding data, removing data, indexing into them, sorting them, determining if an element is in an array.
SWBAT add data, remove data, index into, and sort nested arrays.
SWBAT use hashes to do the following: add key value pairs, retrieve values using a key.

Enumerables(hashes and arrays)

SWBAT iterate over enumerable objects passing a block to the method to be called on each iteration.
SWBAT add elements to a collection whose scope persists after the end of the iteration.
SWBAT return an enumerable from one enumerable method and chain another enumerable immediately after.
SWBAT iterate over an enumerable doing something with each key and value that gets yielded (for example adding all values greater than 10 to an array)
SWBAT skip an iteration.
SWBAT break out of an iteration early.

Nested data structures

SWBAT iterate over one data structure that yields another enumerable object and iterate over those enumerable objects and applying supplying a block to the "inner loop" to be called on each step of the "inner loop".
SWBAT add/remove/replace elements in deeply nested data structures while keeping track of the scope introduced by the iterators.

### PROGRAMMING BASICS, DATA STRUCTURES and ITERATION
* variables
* what does dynamic typing mean?
* arrays and hashes
* negotiating complex data structures

Enumerables

Errors

SWBAT handle errors gracefully.
SWBAT determine which step of an iteration an error is happening on by rescuing exceptions.

Methods
SWBAT write resuable chunks of code which accept variable inputs and can be called aka methods.
SWBAT create methods with variable number of arguments.
SWBAT create methods with default values for arguments.
SWBAT implicitly return values from methods.
SWBAT explicity return values from methods.
SWBAT conditionally exit early from methods 


### METHODS
* methods + parameters + return values
* chaining
* control flow structures

### OBJECTS
* classes + objects + modules
* instance variables and methods
* class variables and constants
* inheritance

### RUBYGEMS
* rubygems - what are they
* oauth
* nokogiri

### PROGRAMMING STYLE AND BEST PRACTICES
* functional vs oo ruby
* object interfaces
* refactoring anti patterns
* metaprogramming (method_missing<- mention when talking about inheritance)
