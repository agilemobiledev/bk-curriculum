4 weeks - project work
** SWBAT == Students Will Be Able To

##GIT + COMMAND LINE + ENV

##THE INTERNET

* SWBAT explain what the client and the server are, and their role in serving a simple website. 
* SWBAT recognize and identify the specific tasks of frontend and backend developers, and be able to confidently discuss the languages, frameworks, and tools unique to each discipline.

* SWBAT rehearse a brief history of web browsers, and in doing so, identify why the evolution of the browser is relevant to web development. 

* SWBAT explain what web standards are, how they are defined, and their relationship to browsers, working groups, and standards bodies.

* SWBAT explain the significance of html5 and css3 and identify the subsequent implications for the future of web standards.

* SWBAT explain what the word, "semantic", means in relation to web development and articulate its role in the evolution of web standards, programming styles, and best practices.

* SWBAT articulate why performance is a particular concern in web development, as well as a high level understanding of best practices for improving the performance of any website or web app.

* SWBAT employ browser developer tools to effectively investigate and debug both local and remote websites and apps.

## MARKUP AND STYLES 

###HTML AND CSS

* SWBAT identify the roles of HTML (content), CSS (styles), and JS (interaction), in the creation of a website and recognize and remedy classic antipatterns that demonstrate a conflation of these roles.

* SWBAT write and recognize the syntax of element, id, class, and compound selectors and understand the DOM elements they apply to.

* SWBAT employ specificity and location to properly control the cascade of their style declarations, and articulate this by employing a strategy that quantifies the priority of a selector based on its composition.

* SWBAT position elements using both the float and position attributes, and be able to properly articulate the relationship positioned elements now have with other elements in the DOM.

* SWBAT articulate historical attempts at clear solutions, identify them as anti-patterns, and successfully refactor them to properly implement the semantic cross-browser friendly clear fix. 
* SWBAT employ an understanding of the box model attributes (content, padding, border, margin) to successfully space elements and predict element width and height.

* SWBAT refactor (or DRY up) stylesheets by using inheritance, combining selectors, employing selector abstraction, and using display types.

* SWBAT properly use and identify style shorthand, and be abl to articulate when and why to use it.

* SWBAT identify the default display type of any common html and element and be able to explain how and why to use the display attribute to change an elements display type.

* SWBAT center any html element, and be able to articulate why and how the centering technique differs for block vs inline elements.

* SWBAT recognize good vs bad online frontend development resources, and be able to query such resources appropriately to find relevant help.

* SWBAT apply twitter bootstrap, HTML5 boilerplate, and CSS resets to expedite their frontend design experience, while also being able to articulate the tradeoffs these tools introduce.

###SASS

* SWBAT employ SASS as a tool to create maintainable, modular stylesheets by using the variable and mixin features.

* SWBAT write and recognize SASS nested selector syntax and be able to articulate the performance vs readabiliy tradeoffs such a feature allows.

* SWBAT refactor (DRY up) their stylesheets by employing SASS selector inheritance.

* SWBAT architect a directory structure and run the SASS command from the terminal to successfully compile SASS/SCSS to CSS.

* SWBAT architect a Sinatra web application to use SASS and COMPASS to produce CSS.

* SWBAT architect a Rails web application to use SASS and COMPASS to produce CSS.

* SWBAT creating custom SASS helpers

###ERB, HAML, and MARKDOWN

* SWBAT write, read, edit, and debug, basic ERB syntax, including loops, iteration, method calls, and interpolation.

* SWBAT write, read, edit, and debug, basic HAML syntax, including loops, iteration, method calls, and interpolation.

* SWBAT write, read, edit, and debug, basic Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, nested lists, code blocks, and inline code.

* SWBAT employ filters while using HAML to address specific content markup needs.

##JS + JQUERY

* difference between js and jquery
* using libraries - do it, but wisely; best practices

### JAVASCRIPT FROM THE CONSOLE: STYLE AND BASICS

* values, variables, control flow
* functions
* data structures: objects + arrays
* error handling

* functional
* object oriented

* searching
* modularity

### JAVACSRIPT AND THE BROWSER/WEB
* web programming
* wtf is the DOM
* browser events
* review HTTP requests

* JSON

### JQUERY

* jquery is terrible. long live jquery.
* when to use jquery and why.
* review css selector syntax
* parent/child ancestor/descendant relationship (review)
* add/remove/toggle class
* append prepend before after
* browser events in jquery
* callbacks lmao

* change markup NOT css

### JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES
* templating with mustache
* frontend MVCs
* d3 or hi charts?


##RUBY

### ENVIRONMENT
* rspec, guard, irb, ruby keyword, installation

### PROGRAMMING BASICS, DATA STRUCTURES and ITERATION
* variables
* what does dynamic typing mean?
* arrays and hashes
* iteration + enumerable methods
* negotiating complex data structures

### METHODS
* methods + parameters + return values
* chaining
* control flow structures

### OBJECTS
* classes + objects + modules
* instance variables and methods
* class variables and constants
* inheritance


### RUBYGEMS
* rubygems - what are they
* oauth
* nokogiri

### PROGRAMMING STYLE AND BEST PRACTICES
* functional vs oo ruby
* object interfaces
* refactoring anti patterns
* metaprogramming (method_missing<- mention when talking about inheritance)

##TESTING

##RACK + SINATRA

* web applications: server side? client side?
* ruby server side applications
* web dev is fancy string concatenation
* single page app with rack
* why the url and routes are so goddamn important
* sinatra routing
* sinatra app architecture
* separation of concerns - keeping your logic out of your views
* using partials
* sinatra models + concerns
* rubygems with bundler
* sinatra and datamapper
* sinatra and active record

##DATABASES + SQL + DATA MODELING

##RAILS - BEGINNER

##RAILS - ADVANCED
